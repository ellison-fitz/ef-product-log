# ef-product-log

Product sourcing log for Ellison & Fitz

**Brand:** Ellison & Fitz  
**Lane:** Backend ops / sourcing  
**Status:** Repo `ellison-fitz/ef-product-log`. Kept separate from `ef-sops` (this log has supplier names and costs).  
**Not for:** VA customer-support pages. CS truth stays on the [live SOP](https://kevinc710.github.io/ef-sops/). Ops how stays in [ops/](https://kevinc710.github.io/ef-sops/ops/).

This file is the current state of every product we are moving between suppliers. Each product page has the current facts at the top and a dated log underneath, newest first. Rewrite the top block in place when a fact changes. Do not stack "Updated" footnotes: put the date in the log.

Site: index.md + products/ render via GitHub Pages (Jekyll). Each product page now has a **Scale read** row (30-day units and trend, margin vs supplier cost, supplier reliability, Meta).

Snapshot taken Sun 2026-10-25, ~10:20 AM CT. Shopify reads (status, price, buyable colors, open orders) are from the Admin API at that time. 30-day sales are Shopify analytics net units for 2026-09-25 to 2026-10-25 (today partial), with the prior 30 days and last 7 (10-19 to 10-25) vs prior 7 days (10-12 to 10-18) for trend. Meta is read-only from ad set and campaign names, last 30 days and 10-22 to 10-24, using Meta-reported purchases and ROAS. The "35 / 1.53" style numbers in ad set names are copied as written; 1.53 is read as the break-even ROAS. Slack and WhatsApp were not re-read for this refresh.

## Rules

| Rule | Current how |
|---|---|
| Main supplier | **Cherry / Beehive** (Beehiveship) |
| Approved backups | **Lay** (Dropsure) and **Hart** (Wio). Use them only for products Cherry can't cover. |
| Traction | 3+ sales in 30 days |
| Substitutes | Never ship a different item, color, size or style without telling the customer first and getting their OK (or offering a refund). |
| Dead tracking | If Shopify shows a Cherry tracking number that never moved, the customer gets an update from Abby before we re-source. |
| Shopify writes | Agents need Kevin's explicit OK. Listing color blocks are done by Leandro or Kevin. |
| WhatsApp | Nobody sends to Lay or Hart unless Kevin says to send that message. |
