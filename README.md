# ef-product-log

Product sourcing log for Ellison & Fitz

**Brand:** Ellison & Fitz  
**Lane:** Backend ops / sourcing  
**Status:** Repo `ellison-fitz/ef-product-log`. Kept separate from `ef-sops` (this log has supplier names and costs).  
**Not for:** VA customer-support pages. CS truth stays on the [live SOP](https://kevinc710.github.io/ef-sops/). Ops how stays in [ops/](https://kevinc710.github.io/ef-sops/ops/).

This file is the current state of every product we are moving between suppliers. Each product page has the current facts at the top and a dated log underneath, newest first. Rewrite the top block in place when a fact changes. Do not stack "Updated" footnotes: put the date in the log.

Site: index.md + products/ render via GitHub Pages (Jekyll). Each product page now has a **Scale read** row (30-day units and trend, margin vs supplier cost, supplier reliability, Meta).

Snapshot taken Sat 2026-11-07, ~10:00 AM CT. Shopify reads (status, price, buyable colors, open orders) are from the Admin API at that time. 30-day sales are Shopify analytics net units (run-analytics-query) for 2026-10-09 to 2026-11-07 (today partial); last 7 days (11-01 to 11-07) vs prior 7 days (10-25 to 10-31) for trend. Analytics nets out returns, so it can read a little under the order count. **Meta was not re-read this run:** Pipeboard Free plan weekly AI tool limit exceeded (31/30 executions; resets Sun Nov 8, 2026 ~6:00 PM CT (2026-11-09T00:00:00Z)). Meta figures below are carry-forward from `Meta 11-03` unless noted. Slack and WhatsApp were not re-read. **Shopify highlights:** Maris weekly units still soft at **16 vs 65** (main campaign was off at last Meta read); Enzo **24 vs 48** with 11 open orders; Maren **0 vs 34**; Denver **0 vs 8**. Freya: 11868 refunded, 12472 (Grey S) newly open; Beck 11943 now **21 days**; Linnea 11661 **32 days**. Camille 11686/11756 now Fulfilled. Not tracked here yet: **Faye Brushed Pullover keeps scaling hard** (204 net units 30d, **196 of them in the last 7 days** vs 7 prior; $39.99; many open units across recent orders; supplier/cost not in this log), Orso Animal Bag (173 units 30d, 98 in 7d vs 33), Bram Rib Cardigan (54 units 30d, 15 in 7d vs 20), Brielle Bow Pullover (**listing still Draft**, last updated 10-31 ~8:05 AM CT; 5 units 30d).

## Sourcing gaps

As of 2026-10-28, Maren row updated 2026-10-31. Rechecked 2026-11-07: no change on Sage/Terracotta confirmation (still shipped 10-30, supplier not recorded). Freya 11868 refunded; 12472 Grey S newly open.

| Product | Gap | Who said no | Next |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Maren Lantern Pullover](products/maren-lantern-pullover.md) | Sage Green and Brick/Terracotta. All 22 backlog orders with them marked shipped 10-30 (YT tracking), supplier not recorded (10-31). | Lay: not available (10-28) | Confirm who shipped, cost, and that the colors match |
| [Beck Waffle Polo](products/beck-waffle-polo.md) | Light Blue, Light Green, Mustard (M, order 11943) | Lay: not available (10-28) | Ask Hart, then Cherry |
| [Camille Knit Sweater](products/camille-knit-sweater.md) | Colors beyond Black/Apricot (11686 Burgundy L, 11756 White S) | Cherry: only Black/Apricot (10-27). Hart: no (10-11) | Lay to confirm her 4 colors |

## Rules

| Rule | Current how |
|---|---|
| Main supplier | **Cherry / Beehive** (Beehiveship) |
| Approved backups | **Lay** (Dropsure) and **Hart** (Wio). Use them only for products Cherry can't cover. |
| Traction | 3+ sales in 30 days |
| Substitutes | Never ship a different item, color, size or style without telling the customer first and getting their OK (or offering a refund). |
| Dead tracking | If Shopify shows a Cherry tracking number that never moved, the customer gets an update from Abby before we re-source. |
| Shopify writes | Agents need Kevin's explicit OK. Listing color blocks are done by Leandro or Kevin. |
| WhatsApp | Nobody sends to Lay or Hart unless Kevin says to send that message. |
